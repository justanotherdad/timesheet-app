# Email Setup (Resend + Supabase SMTP)

This app uses **Supabase Auth** for forgot-password and invite emails. Supabase sends these via the SMTP provider you configure. No code changes are needed—all configuration is in the **Supabase Dashboard**.

---

## Step 1: Verify ctgtimesheet.com in Resend

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter `ctgtimesheet.com`
4. Resend will show **DNS records** to add. You'll typically see:
   - **MX record** (for inbound—optional for sending)
   - **SPF** (TXT record)
   - **DKIM** (TXT record)
5. Copy each record Resend shows (type, name, value)
6. Open **Cloudflare** → select `ctgtimesheet.com` → **DNS** → **Records**
7. For each record, click **Add record**:
   - **MX:** Type = MX, Name = (from Resend, often `@` or domain), Mail server = value from Resend, Priority = 10
   - **TXT (SPF/DKIM):** Type = TXT, Name = (from Resend), Content = value from Resend
8. Save all records
9. In Resend, click **Verify** (or wait a few minutes and refresh). Status should turn green.

## Step 2: Supabase SMTP Configuration

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com) → your project
2. **Project Settings** → **Auth** → **SMTP**
3. Enable **Custom SMTP**
4. Enter:
   - **Host:** `smtp.resend.com`
   - **Port:** `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS)
   - **User:** `resend`
   - **Password:** Your Resend API key (Resend Dashboard → API Keys → Create → copy)
   - **Sender email:** `no-reply@ctgtimesheet.com`
   - **Sender name:** `CTG Timesheet` (optional)
5. Click **Save**

## Step 3: Redirect URLs (required for forgot password)

1. Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Under **Redirect URLs**, add (one per line):
   - `https://ctgtimesheet.com/auth/callback`
   - `https://ctgtimesheet.com/auth/callback?next=/auth/setup-password`
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for local testing)
3. Set **Site URL** to `https://ctgtimesheet.com`
4. Click **Save**

---

## Step 4: Test Forgot Password

1. Go to https://ctgtimesheet.com (or your app URL)
2. Click **Forgot password?**
3. Enter an email that exists in Supabase Auth (e.g. a user who has already been invited)
4. Click **Send Reset Link**
5. Check:
   - Your inbox and spam
   - Resend Dashboard → **Emails** (see if it was sent and delivered)
   - Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Logs** (see any errors)

## Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|--------|--------------|
| Error `{}` or blank | Redirect URL not in allowlist, or SMTP credentials wrong. Check Supabase Auth logs. |
| "Failed to send" | SMTP misconfigured. Verify Resend API key, port (465/587), and sender domain is verified. |
| Email not received | Check spam; verify domain in Resend; check Resend delivery logs. |
| "User not found" | The email must exist in Supabase Auth. Forgot password only works for users who have already been invited/signed up. |

## No Code Changes Needed

The app calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`. Supabase handles:
- Sending the email via your SMTP
- Token generation
- Redirect flow

Your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (or `window.location.origin`) is used for the redirect—ensure it matches your production domain so the reset link works.
